    <p>
      Definitely use very large shrimp for this shrimp oreganata recipe. Think
      shrimp scampi meets a crunchy baked Parmesan topping. You can serve them
      as an appetizer, on top of cooked pasta with extra lemon-butter sauce, or
      simply with some grilled bread and flavorful olive oil to dip in.

      <li>
        2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided, plus more for garnish

      <li>2 tablespoons chopped garlic, divided</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest, divided</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons crushed red pepper, divided</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, divided</li>
      <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Direction (Steps) on how to prepare</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking
        sheet with aluminum foil and lightly spray with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>Peel shrimp, leaving tails intact.</li>
      <li>
        Use a paring knife to cut lengthwise down vein side of shrimp, cutting
        almost but not all the way through the shrimp. Remove the vein and
        gently press shrimp apart to butterfly it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine shrimp, wine, olive oil, salt, 1 tablespoon parsley, 1
        tablespoon garlic, 1 teaspoon lemon zest, and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red
        pepper in a bowl; toss to coat shrimp evenly. Let stand at room
        temperature for at least 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, combine panko, Parmesan cheese, 2 tablespoons melted butter,
        and remaining 1 tablespoon parsley, 1 tablespoon garlic, 1 teaspoon
        lemon zest, and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper in a small bowl; stir
        until well blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove shrimp from marinade and place, cut side up, about 2 inches apart
        on the prepared baking sheet. Top each shrimp with about 2 teaspoons
        panko mixture, pressing lightly to adhere.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until shrimp are cooked through, 8 to 10
        minutes. Without opening oven, switch oven to broil. Broil until topping
        is golden brown and crispy, 1 to 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer shrimp to a platter. Stir together lemon juice, remaining 1
        tablespoon melted butter and any accumulated juices from the baking
        sheet in a small bowl; drizzle evenly over shrimp on platter and garnish
        with parsley. Serve hot with lemon wedges.
      </li>
    </ol>
