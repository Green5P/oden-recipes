    <h3>How to make Strawberry Rhubarb Drop Biscuits</h3>
    <p>
      We don’t like to waste too much time around here arguing semantics. I’m
      sort of burying the lead, which is that these are easy to make, impressive
      to look at, and very delicious to eat. Here are some notes from the chef:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Pantry staples:</strong>I really wanted to use self-rising flour
      in this, since I think it does a great job no matter what type of biscuits
      you’re making, but every once in a while I like to show that we can get
      virtually the same results with regular flour and baking powder.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Fruity flavora</strong> These will work with many other types of
      fruit, but the combination of strawberries and rhubarb is hard to beat,
      especially after the bonus maceration step we’ve employed. They just go
      together so well.
    </p>

    <p>Worthy celebration:</p>

    </ul>

    <h4>Direction (Steps) on how to prepare</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut ribs of rhubarb in half lengthwise and slice into 1/4-inch pieces;
        place into a bowl. Add cubed strawberries and 2 tablespoons sugar. Toss
        to combine, cover, and let fruit macerate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2
        hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a mixing bowl;
        whisk to combine.
      </li>
      <li>Peel shrimp, leaving tails intact.</li>
      <li>
        Drain fruit in a strainer set over a bowl. Reserve the syrupy juices
        that pass through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved fruit juices, and pour in buttermilk.
        Mix with a fork just until the dry ingredients are incorporated into the
        dough. If the mixture is too dry to come together, add a little more
        buttermilk. If it seems too wet, and sticky, add a little more flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with a silpat mat.Meanwhile, combine panko, Parmesan cheese, 2
        tablespoons melted butter, and remaining 1 tablespoon parsley, 1
        tablespoon garlic, 1 teaspoon lemon zest, and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red
        pepper in a small bowl; stir until well blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        RScoop or spoon equal portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet.
        Whisk together egg and water in a small bowl. Brush biscuits with egg
        wash, and sprinkle with sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack
        and let cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix powdered sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice together in a small bowl
        for the lemon icing. Fill icing into a piping bag or a plastic bag with
        the tip cut off and drizzle icing over cooled biscuits.
      </li>
    </ol>
